First of all, don't download random stuff off the internet. Don't download Executables (exe-files) from people you don't know and definitely don't just run them.

However, I pinky promise that this program was not made maliciously and any issues arriving from its use are likely due to my personal shortcomings.

Anyway. To use it, you must download all the files, put them in a folder. Run the EXE (see above), a console should pop up saying everything's groovy. You can now open a browser to "localhost:5000" and have fun.
